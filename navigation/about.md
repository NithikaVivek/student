# 👋 Hey, I'm Nithika  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet!  
This page is about the side of me outside of school and research — the little things that make me smile, the quirks that make me *me*, and all the fun parts of life I love sharing.

## 🎉 Things I Love  

Here are a few things that always brighten my day:  

- 🎶 **Music** — I’ve even explored how different types of music affect memory. You’ll catch me listening to everything from chill beats when I’m relaxing, to upbeat tracks that turn into mini dance parties.  
- 🧩 **Logic puzzles** — Give me a brain teaser or a tricky problem and I’ll happily lose track of time solving it. It’s kind of my way of unwinding.  
- 🎮 **Games** — From strategy games that need serious planning, to silly fun ones you just play to laugh, I enjoy them all.  
- 📸 **Taking pictures** — I’m that person who takes way too many photos of random little things. Later, those pictures turn into the best memory triggers.  
- ✈️ **Adventures & travel** — I’m curious about new places, whether that’s exploring a different city or just finding a cool café down the street.  
- 🍕 **Food** — Pizza, snacks, and boba are basically the holy trinity of happiness.

## 🌟 Fun Facts About Me  

Here’s a quick list of the quirky, random, but very real things about me:  

- I will *always* say yes to boba. Always.  
- If I’m solving a puzzle, don’t expect me to hear anything else.  
- I love music so much I connect songs to specific memories or moods.  
- I take sunset photos even if I already have 100 of them.  
- When I travel, I care more about the food than the tourist spots.  
- I’d rather have a cozy night with snacks and games than a big event.  
- I laugh at my own jokes more than anyone else does.  
- My friends say I give off “puzzle master but also snack provider” vibes.

## 💜 Family & Fun  

Family is at the center of my world.  
Some of my best memories are just little traditions, goofy moments, and the laughter that comes from being together.  

I believe family isn’t just about who you’re related to — it’s also about the people who stick by you, cheer you on, and make life brighter. Those are the people I treasure most.

## 🏖️ Adventures & Everyday Joys  

Life is full of big adventures, but honestly, I love the small ones just as much:  

- Trying new snacks (and occasionally regretting it 😅).  
- Watching the ocean and just zoning out.  
- Going for late-night drives with good music playing.  
- Planning a trip and getting more excited about the snacks I’ll bring than the actual itinerary.  
- Taking way too many pictures of clouds, sunsets, and random pretty spots.  

For me, adventures aren’t always about going far — sometimes they’re just about looking at ordinary days with a bit of curiosity.

## 🧩 The Puzzle Side of Me  

Logic puzzles deserve their own section because they’re that important to me. I love the feeling of staring at something that makes zero sense at first, and then slowly figuring out the pattern. It’s like solving little mysteries.  

Sometimes I think puzzles are the perfect metaphor for life:  
- Start with chaos.  
- Look for patterns.  
- Try a few wrong paths.  
- Eventually, things click.

## 🎶 The Soundtrack of My Life  

Music is basically the background to everything I do. Some moods need calm, lo-fi beats; others need energy and rhythm. I’ll connect a random song to a specific memory, so my playlists are like a personal time machine.  

Some examples:  
- A song I overplayed during a road trip still instantly takes me back there.  
- Certain tracks remind me of summer nights with friends.  
- Some songs aren’t just music — they’re motivation in disguise.

## 🌈 Wrapping It Up  

So that’s me, in all my puzzle-loving, music-obsessed, photo-taking, pizza-and-boba-fueled chaos.  
Life isn’t about being perfect or polished — it’s about collecting the moments that make you smile, the people who make you feel at home, and the adventures (big or small) that keep things interesting.  

Thanks for stopping by 💜
