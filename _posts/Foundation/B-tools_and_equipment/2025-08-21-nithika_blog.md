## Tools & Equipment
**Example Evidence:** Screenshots of VSCode setup, GitHub repository connections, Makefile executions  
**Reflection:** This week, I focused heavily on optimizing my development workflow. I explored different VSCode extensions (such as GitHub integration tools, linters, and formatting aids), verified GitHub repository connections, and tested my Makefile scripts to automate repetitive tasks. These steps helped me streamline my work, reduce manual errors, and create a more efficient environment for coding. I also began to understand how a well-configured toolchain saves time in debugging and allows me to focus on actual problem-solving instead of setup issues.  

**VSCode Setup**  
*This screenshot shows my VSCode environment with extensions installed, color themes adjusted, and GitHub repository linked for seamless commit and push operations.*

## Portfolio & Blogging
**Example Evidence:** Published blog posts demonstrating problem-solving and project updates  
**Reflection:** Maintaining my portfolio and writing blog posts allowed me to reflect on the challenges I faced and the solutions I implemented. By documenting problems in detail and describing how I solved them, I reinforced my own learning and created a reference I can revisit later. I also recognized the importance of explaining technical work to both technical and non-technical audiences, which is a valuable skill for future collaboration and career growth.  

**Blog Screenshot**  
*This screenshot captures one of my blog entries where I documented coding challenges and shared the specific solutions I implemented, showing my problem-solving journey.*

## Theme, Style, Layout
**Example Evidence:** Before-and-after screenshots of site design changes  
**Reflection:** I made deliberate design choices around layout, color schemes, and typography to improve usability and readability. I experimented with gradient backgrounds, font hierarchy, and spacing adjustments to make the site both visually engaging and user-friendly. These decisions not only improved the visual appeal of my site but also made it easier for readers to navigate and understand my projects. I also learned how small design adjustments can create a more polished and professional feel.  

**Prior to OOP Implementation**  
*This screenshot shows the site before implementing object-oriented programming concepts, with basic design elements and less interactive features.*

**Original OOP Implementation**  
*This image illustrates my initial attempt at using OOP for the Rock Paper Scissors game. While functional, it had design and animation issues that made the experience clunky.*

**Fixed OOP Implementation**

## JavaScript Frontend Basics
**Example Evidence:** Code snippets, commit history, interactive UI components  
**Reflection:** I applied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make my web pages more interactive and user-friendly. I learned how to combine Markdown for structured content with JavaScript for dynamic elements such as animations and clickable components. My commit history shows the step-by-step development process, and my code snippets highlight how I used event listeners and DOM manipulation to build functionality. These experiences helped me improve not only in writing JS logic but also in debugging errors and iterating quickly.  

**RPS JS Logic**  
*This code snippet shows the logic for Rock Paper Scissors gameplay, including user input, computer choice, and outcome handling.*

**OOP Snippet**  
*This snippet demonstrates my use of object-oriented programming principles to structure the game in a cleaner, reusable way.*

**Commit History**  
*These screenshots capture parts of my Git commit history, highlighting iterative changes, bug fixes, and feature additions to the project over time. These are only some of the commits I made, others are present on the repo: https://github.com/illuminati1618/pages-thinkers-yash*

## AI Evidence in Work
**Example Evidence:** Prompts, generated outputs, and my refined results  
**Reflection:** AI tools provided valuable assistance in generating drafts and brainstorming possible implementations. For example, when I needed help with OOP class functions for animation, the AI gave me starting points that I could refine. However, I realized that raw AI suggestions often needed adjustments to work properly in my codebase. This taught me how to critically evaluate AI output, test it in context, and improve it to align with my specific goals.  

**AI Prompt and Output**  
*This screenshot shows an AI-assisted output based on my prompt about animating OOP class functions, which I then modified to fit into my project.*

## Manifesto Evidence
**Example Evidence:** Peer review logs, joint commits, collaborative screenshots  
**Reflection:** Collaborating with peers gave me new perspectives on problem-solving, coding style, and debugging strategies. Peer reviews highlighted errors I overlooked, while joint coding sessions helped me practice communicating my reasoning more effectively. This collaboration not only improved the quality of my projects but also taught me how teamwork accelerates learning and creativity.  

**Peer Review Log**  
*This screenshot shows an example comment I made on a peer's issue.*

*This screenshot shows documented feedback from peers, which guided me in fixing bugs and improving readability of my code.*

## Learning Through Mistakes
**Example Evidence:** Bug logs, fix notes, before-and-after comparisons  
**Reflection:** Mistakes this week became my most valuable teachers. Errors such as unrecognized RPS functions in the console or failed animations forced me to trace the problem, analyze root causes, and fix them systematically. Through these experiences, I developed stronger debugging habits, patience, and the ability to anticipate issues before they appear. Each bug I encountered became a stepping stone toward mastering both technical skills and problem-solving mindset.  

**Main Bugs:**  
- Getting the RPS Play function to be recognized in the console  
- Fixing flowchart paths in lesson, as well as using HTML to code a flowchart with graphics  
- Creating an OOP object that actually animated without using DOM  
------
OOP
**Original OOP Implementation**  
*This screenshot shows the flawed version of my OOP code where animations did not trigger properly and the design was inconsistent.*

**Fixed OOP Implementation**  
*This screenshot shows the corrected OOP version with working animations and a cleaner interface, representing a major debugging milestone.*

Layout
