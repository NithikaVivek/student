## Theme, Style, Layout
**Example Evidence:** Before-and-after screenshots of site design changes  
**Reflection:** I made deliberate design choices around layout, color schemes, and typography to improve usability and readability. I experimented with gradient backgrounds, font hierarchy, and spacing adjustments to make the site both visually engaging and user-friendly. These decisions not only improved the visual appeal of my site but also made it easier for readers to navigate and understand my projects. I also learned how small design adjustments can create a more polished and professional feel.  

Throughout Sprint 1, I dedicated time to refining the look and feel of my website. I started by analyzing the initial design, which was functional but lacked visual interest and clarity. The basic layout made it difficult for users to find information quickly, and the color scheme did not reflect the personality of my projects.

To address these issues, I experimented with different layout structures, including grid and flexbox arrangements, to create a more organized and responsive interface. I chose a dark gradient background for a modern look and adjusted font sizes and weights to establish a clear hierarchy. Adding spacing between sections and elements improved readability and made the site feel less cluttered.

Color selection was another important aspect. I tested various palettes until I found one that balanced vibrancy with professionalism. Accent colors were used to highlight important buttons and links, while neutral tones provided a comfortable reading experience. I also incorporated custom icons and images to give the site a unique identity.

Typography played a key role in enhancing usability. I selected fonts that were easy to read and paired them thoughtfully for headings and body text. Consistent use of font styles helped guide users through the content and made the site more visually appealing.

One of the biggest challenges was integrating object-oriented programming concepts into the design, especially for interactive features like the Rock Paper Scissors game. My first attempt resulted in clunky animations and inconsistent styling, but through debugging and iteration, I was able to create smoother transitions and a cohesive look.

Overall, working on theme, style, and layout taught me the importance of user experience and attention to detail. I learned that even small adjustments can have a big impact on how a site is perceived and used. These skills will be valuable as I continue to develop and design web projects in the future.

**Fixed OOP Implementation**
