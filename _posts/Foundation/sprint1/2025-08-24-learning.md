## Learning Through Mistakes
**Example Evidence:** Bug logs, fix notes, before-and-after comparisons  
**Reflection:** Mistakes this week became my most valuable teachers. Errors such as unrecognized RPS functions in the console or failed animations forced me to trace the problem, analyze root causes, and fix them systematically. Through these experiences, I developed stronger debugging habits, patience, and the ability to anticipate issues before they appear. Each bug I encountered became a stepping stone toward mastering both technical skills and problem-solving mindset.  

Debugging is an essential part of the development process, and Sprint 1 provided many opportunities to strengthen my skills. When I encountered issues like the RPS Play function not being recognized in the console, I learned to break down the problem, check for typos, and use console logging to trace the flow of execution. Fixing flowchart paths and coding graphics in HTML required careful attention to detail and a willingness to experiment with different solutions until I found what worked.

One of the most challenging bugs was creating an OOP object that animated correctly without relying on the DOM. This required a deep understanding of JavaScript classes, object properties, and animation logic. By reviewing documentation, testing different approaches, and seeking feedback from peers, I was able to overcome these obstacles and improve my code.

Each mistake taught me something new about programming and problem-solving. I learned to be patient, persistent, and open to feedback. Documenting my bugs and fixes helped me track my progress and build a reference for future projects. I also realized the importance of maintaining a positive attitude and viewing mistakes as opportunities for growth rather than setbacks.

**Main Bugs:**  
- Getting the RPS Play function to be recognized in the console  
- Fixing flowchart paths in lesson, as well as using HTML to code a flowchart with graphics  
- Creating an OOP object that actually animated without using DOM

OOP

**Fixed OOP Implementation**  
*This screenshot shows the corrected OOP version with working animations and a cleaner interface, representing a major debugging milestone.*
