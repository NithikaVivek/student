## Portfolio & Blogging
**Example Evidence:** Published blog posts demonstrating problem-solving and project updates  
**Reflection:** Maintaining my portfolio and writing blog posts allowed me to reflect on the challenges I faced and the solutions I implemented. By documenting problems in detail and describing how I solved them, I reinforced my own learning and created a reference I can revisit later. I also recognized the importance of explaining technical work to both technical and non-technical audiences, which is a valuable skill for future collaboration and career growth.  

Building and maintaining my portfolio has been a transformative experience throughout Sprint 1. I used my blog to record coding challenges, project milestones, and the strategies I used to overcome obstacles. Each post served as a snapshot of my progress, allowing me to look back and see how much Iâ€™ve grown as a developer.

Writing about technical problems forced me to think critically about my solutions and break down complex concepts into understandable steps. This process not only clarified my own understanding but also made it easier to share knowledge with others. I learned to use Markdown for clear formatting, include code snippets and screenshots for context, and organize my posts so readers could follow my journey.

My portfolio also became a valuable tool for collaboration. By sharing my work publicly, I invited feedback from peers and mentors, which helped me identify areas for improvement and discover new approaches. The act of publishing regularly kept me accountable and motivated to keep learning and experimenting.

Documenting my work has also prepared me for future opportunities. Whether applying for internships, collaborating on open-source projects, or simply sharing my story, having a well-organized portfolio demonstrates my skills and commitment to growth. I now appreciate the importance of good documentation and plan to continue blogging as I advance in my coding career.
