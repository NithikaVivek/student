## Manifesto Evidence
**Example Evidence:** Peer review logs, joint commits, collaborative screenshots  
**Reflection:** Collaborating with peers gave me new perspectives on problem-solving, coding style, and debugging strategies. Peer reviews highlighted errors I overlooked, while joint coding sessions helped me practice communicating my reasoning more effectively. This collaboration not only improved the quality of my projects but also taught me how teamwork accelerates learning and creativity.  

Throughout Sprint 1, I actively participated in peer reviews and collaborative coding sessions. Reviewing my classmates' code allowed me to spot issues I might have missed in my own work and learn new techniques from their approaches. I provided constructive feedback on pull requests, commented on specific lines of code, and discussed possible solutions to bugs. These interactions helped me develop a more critical eye for code quality and fostered a sense of community within our team.

Joint commits and pair programming sessions were especially valuable. Working together on features or debugging problems in real time made it easier to share knowledge and divide tasks efficiently. I learned how to communicate my ideas clearly, listen to others' suggestions, and compromise when necessary to reach the best solution. These experiences also taught me the importance of documenting changes and keeping everyone informed about project progress.

Teaching and mentoring peers was another highlight of Sprint 1. I had the opportunity to help a CSP student set up Makefile scripts and understand the basics of automation. Explaining concepts to others reinforced my own understanding and gave me confidence in my technical skills. It was rewarding to see my classmates succeed and to know that I contributed to their learning journey.

Collaboration extended beyond coding. We shared resources, discussed best practices, and supported each other through challenges. This environment of mutual respect and encouragement made the learning process more enjoyable and productive. I now appreciate the value of teamwork and look forward to future projects where I can continue to learn from and contribute to my peers.
