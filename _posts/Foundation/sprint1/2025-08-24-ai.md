## AI Evidence in Work
**Example Evidence:** Prompts, generated outputs, and my refined results  
**Reflection:** AI tools provided valuable assistance in generating drafts and brainstorming possible implementations. For example, when I needed help with OOP class functions for animation, the AI gave me starting points that I could refine. However, I realized that raw AI suggestions often needed adjustments to work properly in my codebase. This taught me how to critically evaluate AI output, test it in context, and improve it to align with my specific goals.  

Throughout Sprint 1, I experimented with several AI-powered coding assistants and prompt-based tools. These tools helped me quickly generate code snippets, debug errors, and brainstorm solutions for complex problems. For instance, when working on object-oriented programming for my Rock Paper Scissors game, I used AI to suggest class structures and animation logic. While the initial output was helpful, I had to adapt and optimize the code to fit my projectâ€™s requirements and ensure it worked seamlessly with my existing setup.

AI also played a role in documentation and content creation. I used AI to draft blog posts, summarize technical concepts, and create flowcharts for my portfolio. This not only saved time but also improved the clarity and organization of my work. However, I learned that relying solely on AI can sometimes lead to generic or incomplete solutions, so I made it a habit to review, edit, and personalize every AI-generated result.

The most valuable lesson was learning to use AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for my own problem-solving skills. By combining AI suggestions with my own expertise, I was able to produce higher-quality code and documentation. This approach also encouraged me to think critically about the solutions provided and to continuously improve my workflow.
