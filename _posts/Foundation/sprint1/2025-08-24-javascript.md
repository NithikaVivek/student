## JavaScript Frontend Basics
**Example Evidence:** Code snippets, commit history, interactive UI components  
**Reflection:** I applied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make my web pages more interactive and user-friendly. I learned how to combine Markdown for structured content with JavaScript for dynamic elements such as animations and clickable components. My commit history shows the step-by-step development process, and my code snippets highlight how I used event listeners and DOM manipulation to build functionality. These experiences helped me improve not only in writing JS logic but also in debugging errors and iterating quickly.  

Throughout Sprint 1, I dedicated significant time to mastering JavaScript fundamentals and applying them to real-world projects. I started by building simple interactive components, such as buttons and forms, and gradually progressed to more complex features like animations and game logic. One of my main projects was the Rock Paper Scissors game, where I implemented user input handling, random computer choices, and dynamic outcome displays using JavaScript.

I also explored object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript, which allowed me to structure my code in a more modular and reusable way. By creating classes and objects for different game elements, I was able to simplify the logic and make future updates easier. This approach not only improved the maintainability of my code but also deepened my understanding of OOP concepts.

Debugging was a crucial part of my learning process. I encountered various issues, such as event listeners not firing correctly or animations behaving unexpectedly. By using browser developer tools and console logging, I was able to trace problems and implement effective fixes. Each bug I resolved contributed to my growth as a developer and taught me valuable troubleshooting skills.

Version control played an important role in my workflow. I made frequent commits to my GitHub repository, documenting each change and tracking my progress over time. Reviewing my commit history helped me identify patterns in my development process and areas for improvement. Collaborating with peers through pull requests and code reviews also provided valuable feedback and new perspectives.

Overall, working with JavaScript in Sprint 1 was both challenging and rewarding. I gained practical experience in frontend development, improved my coding skills, and built a foundation for future projects.
