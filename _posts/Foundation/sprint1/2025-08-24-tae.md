## Tools & Equipment
**Example Evidence:** Screenshots of VSCode setup, GitHub repository connections, Makefile executions  
**Reflection:** This week, I focused heavily on optimizing my development workflow. I explored different VSCode extensions (such as GitHub integration tools, linters, and formatting aids), verified GitHub repository connections, and tested my Makefile scripts to automate repetitive tasks. These steps helped me streamline my work, reduce manual errors, and create a more efficient environment for coding. I also began to understand how a well-configured toolchain saves time in debugging and allows me to focus on actual problem-solving instead of setup issues.  

Setting up my development environment was a crucial first step in Sprint 1. I customized VSCode with a dark theme, installed extensions for GitHub integration, and configured linters to catch errors early. This setup made it easier to write clean code, manage repositories, and collaborate with others. I also learned how to use the built-in terminal and version control features to streamline my workflow.

Connecting my projects to GitHub was another important milestone. By linking my local codebase to a remote repository, I was able to track changes, create branches for new features, and use pull requests for code reviews. This process improved my organization and made it easier to work with teammates on shared projects.

Automation played a key role in boosting my productivity. I wrote Makefile scripts to automate common tasks like building, testing, and deploying my code. These scripts reduced the risk of manual errors and saved time, allowing me to focus on solving problems and developing new features. I also experimented with customizing Makefile commands to fit the specific needs of each project.

Overall, investing time in setting up my tools and automating my workflow paid off throughout Sprint 1. I was able to work more efficiently, catch bugs early, and collaborate effectively with my peers. These skills will continue to benefit me as I take on more complex projects in the future.
